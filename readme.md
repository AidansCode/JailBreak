# JailBreak

Just a small Garry's Mod gamemode I'm making for fun

### Next Steps (In Order):

- Map rotation

  - With voting system? Maybe later

- Improved automated message system (colored messages)

- Custom gamemode physics (jump height, walk speed, sprint speed, etc.)

- All doors open automatically one minute into the round

- Custom scoreboard (sorted by team)

- Swap list

### Low Priority Next Steps (I'll get to them when I get to them)

- Decide on a decent CSS weapon pack to include with the gamemode

- Map Spawn Entities system improvements

  - Set material on entities

  - Add ability to remove an entity from the map's spawn entities list ingame (not having to edit the json file)
