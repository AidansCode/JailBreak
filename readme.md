# JailBreak

Just a small Garry's Mod gamemode I'm making for fun

### Next Steps (In Order):

- Code cleanup/reorganization

- Team models, team loadouts

- Warden system

- Weapon spawns

- Ability to block off OP vents/areas

  - Maybe, we'll see how hard this is. I should be able to just save a list of (prop, material, position, angle) in a list for each map. Then respawn those in and freeze them after each game.CleanUpMap.

  - If that is the case, this is no different than above point (Weapon spawns) and I can knock them both out at once
