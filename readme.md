# JailBreak

Just a small Garry's Mod gamemode I'm making for fun

### Next Steps (In Order):

- Auto team balancing on round start

- Warden system

- Weapon spawns

- Ability to block off OP vents/areas

  - Maybe, we'll see how hard this is. I should be able to just save a list of (prop, material, position, angle) in a list for each map. Then respawn those in and freeze them after each game.CleanUpMap.

  - If that is the case, this is no different than above point (Weapon spawns) and I can knock them both out at once

- Prevent player suicide (kill in console) unless one prisoner is alive

- Prevent player damage unless round state is IN_PROGRESS

### Low Priority Next Steps (I'll get to them when I get to them)

- Decide on a decent CSS weapon pack to include with the gamemode
